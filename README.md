# Upgrade.2 User Interface

## Project description

In UPGRADE the audience enters a place to feel good. Soft, cozy, cute. But it's important not to waste any time. Because there is only half an hour to prepare the upcoming birthday party for Mr. X. Guided by an electronically modified teddy bear, the audience completes challenges that gradually leave a somewhat strange aftertaste. Recommended for big children who want to be little again. ðŸ’•
With the support of SKAM Stuttgart and Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart.

With Philipp C. Mayer (Duo Shape of Mustard)
Premiered at Remise Bukarest, Stuttgart (DE) 8/12/2023

## User Interface

This repository contains the user interface the audience uses to complete tasks.
The UI is coded as a web applicaton running on a local server.
A (hidden) performer controls the app through left and right arrow keys. The audience can only navigate through the user interface with a mouse.

There are 3 tasks called 'dance', 'sequencer' and 'song'. Before starting each task, the audience has to solve a riddle using objects in the room around them.
After solving the riddle, they get auditive instructions by Bear on completing a task. This includes a party-dance, a musical sequence on a midi controller and a birthday song. After each task, the audience is rewarded with a balloon, used for preparing Mr. X's birthday party.
